        My favorite sports pub serves this, and I've come up with a 
        simple and delicious home version. Many local restaurants sell 
        wing sauce, and most grocery stores carry it near the steak and 
        BBQ sauces. It's rich, so serve in squares as an appetizer. Serve 
        ranch dressing, celery, and carrot sticks on the side. Enjoy!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <li>1 cup diced cooked chicken breast</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons Buffalo wing sauce</li>
        <li>Â½ cup Buffalo wing sauce</li>
        <li>1 (4 ounce) package crumbled blue cheese</li>

            <h3>One</h3>
            Preheat oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C). 
            Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Two</h3>
            Place pizza crust on the prepared baking sheet.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Three</h3>
            Mix chicken and 3 tablespoons wing 
            sauce together in a bowl until evenly coated.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Four</h3>
            Spread 1/2 cup wing sauce on the pizza crust; 
            top with blue cheese, chicken mixture, and celery. 
            Cover pizza with mozzarella cheese.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Five</h3>
            Bake in the preheated oven until pizza is cooked through 
            and cheese is bubbling, about 12 minutes. Cool pizza about 
            5 minutes before cutting into squares.
