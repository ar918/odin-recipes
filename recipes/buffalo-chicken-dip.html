        This Instant Pot Buffalo chicken dip is easy to make if all you 
        have is frozen chicken breasts. They cook with broth in a pressure 
        cooker for just 30 minutes, are shredded, and then combined with 
        cream cheese, Sriracha, ranch dressing, chile-garlic sauce, and 
        cheese for a tasty Buffalo dip. Instructions for thawed chicken 
        are included.

            <h3>One</h3>
            Combine chicken breasts and broth in a multi-functional 
            pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot). Close and lock the lid. 
            Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; 
            set the timer for 10 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure 
            to build.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Two</h3>
            Release pressure using the natural-release method according to 
            manufacturer's instructions for 10 minutes. Release remaining 
            pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to 
            manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove 
            the lid. Transfer chicken to a bowl and shred.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Three</h3>
            Select Sauté function. Add cream cheese, Sriracha, ranch dressing, 
            and chile-garlic sauce to the pot. Stir in shredded chicken. 
            Add Cheddar cheese a little at a time, constantly stirring until 
            melted and all ingredients are well combined. Select Keep Warm 
            function until ready to serve. Garnish with green onions.
