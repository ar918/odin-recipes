    <p>
        Mexican-style shrimp cocktails are commonly spotted on menus in the 
        Bay Area of California, but they don't seem to have caught on elsewhere — 
        which is surprising since you can pretty much get Mexican food like tacos 
        and burritos in just about any corner of the country. This is my version; 
        you can make it your own by using these ingredients and amounts as a 
        rough guide.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup clam juice</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 pound large shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups peeled, seeded, diced ripe tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 cup diced English cucumber</li>
        <li>½ cup diced celery</li>
        <li>½ cup finely diced red onion</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons seeded and diced jalapeno peppers</li>
        <li>½ cup ketchup</li>
        <li>2 medium limes, juiced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons freshly chopped cilantro, plus more for garnish</li>
        <li>1 dash Mexican-style hot sauce</li>
        <li>1 large Hass avocado, cubed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Bring clam juice and oregano to a boil in a saucepan over 
            medium-high heat. Add shrimp; cook and stir just until shrimp 
            turn pink, about 2 minutes. (They will not be cooked through.) 
            Transfer shrimp to a bowl with a slotted spoon; let cool to 
            room temperature. Reserve liquid.
        </li>
        <li>
            While the shrimp are cooling, combine tomatoes, cucumbers, celery, 
            onion, and jalapeños in a mixing bowl. Gently mix in reserved cooking 
            liquid, ketchup, lime juice, 2 tablespoons cilantro, and hot sauce until 
            well combined.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place four whole shrimp in a small bowl; cover with plastic wrap. 
            Chop remaining shrimp into bite-sized pieces; add to vegetable mixture 
            and stir to combine. Cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate both bowls 
            until thoroughly chilled, 2 to 3 hours.
        </li>
        <li>
            When ready to serve, stir avocado into the shrimp cocktail. Divide into 
            four glass bowls; top each with a chilled whole shrimp and garnish with 
            cilantro.
        </li>
    </ol>
